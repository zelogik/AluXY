It's an simple CoreXY printer.

Optimized for people who have a milling machine and some aluminium plate.

I have draw this printer to:
	- Have a CoreXY instead of an HBot or any cartesian printer, no motor movement, no movement of the printed part on Y, etc..
	- No motors, belts and guides on the outside of the frame, for put an enclosure easily.
	- Rigid Frame with aluminium profile.
	- An optimized ratio between printable area and total size or the printer.
	- Nice looking 3D printer (Yes, a beautiful 3D printer work better than a ugly one ... no ...maybe not really true ...) 
	- Optimized mechanical constraints.

Work in progress... (And maybe never finish...)(Don't wait for BOM, Installation Manual, etc..., BUT any comments or commits are welcomed)
THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - IT IS NOT YET FINISHED. Use at your own risk.
